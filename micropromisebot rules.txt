micropromisebot rules

when someone posts a promise:
- crearte a new promise row
	- record time
	- target time
	- target
- for each comment
- If comment starts with: PLEDGE
		- create pledge row, joined to promise row
		- add user
- if comment starts with: WATCH
		- create reminder row
		- remind user when promise is up
			- via DM, capture response to DM
when promise is up:
	- remind prmiser of their promise
	- remind pledges of their pledge
	- make a thread 
		- include context, link to original thread
		- if pomiser/pledge responded to DM, include that as quote
		- link to promiser & pledge so they get replies to their inbox?
	- 
When you get reminded of a promise or a pledge, reply to the  DM saying KEPT or NOT KEPT. If you don't reply, we will assume not kept. The bot will then post the results in the REULSTS thread.

Flair:
- [promises kept] / [promises made]
- [pledges made] / [pledges kept]
